Problem sets in artificial intelligence - a work in progress  

The sample input contains statements which  will give the relationship between the other planet's merchant's language and our earth's language with roman numerals. Based upon this input, a number of questions can be asked.
It would be something like this:

glob is I  
prok is V  
pish is X  
tegj is L  
glob glob Silver is 34 Credits  
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits  
pish pish Iron is 3910 Credits  
how much is pish tegj glob glob ?  
how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?  
how many Credits is glob prok Gold ?  
how many Credits is glob prok Iron ?  
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck= wood ?  

Output :  

pish tegj glob glob is 42  
glob prok Silver is 68 Credits  
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits  
glob prok Iron is 782 Credits
